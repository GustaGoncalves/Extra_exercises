# Extra_exercises
This are a bunch of additional exercises from college
that I've decided to put way more effort
than was asked or anyone really should on such simple things.
Was a pretty fun experience to apply error catchers
Input validation, lists and such on them though
I've actually done some of these before back when I started
learning python, so this was a good revisit/revamp of those
old codes I made
